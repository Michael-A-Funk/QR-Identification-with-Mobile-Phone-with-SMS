## Background and Goal

This app is the software framework for the Article "Paper-Code-Az: Steps for Assembling a Paper-Code for an Educational Robotic System" with the following Abstract:

ABSTRACT:
"In this article we present the Paper-Code-Az project that aims to implement a tangible programming language platform, in which the code is read by a mobile device camera, to be used by an Arduino robot for elementary school children. A description of the different stages of the project is discussed. In the context of the first phase, a language syntax is proposed, as well as the design of the blocks that constitute the elements of tangible language. Also discussed is the way in which each element of the language has an associated fiduciary label that guarantees its translation so that the program code can be executed by the robot."
